# How Technology Helps People?

Nowadays, we live in an advanced world. We use many new inventions
that people long ago never imagined. In the past, people could not
regularly communicate with others. It took days ,weeks, or even months
just to send a letter. There were no telephones. So people had to talk
face to face.
