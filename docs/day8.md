# The Government of the United States

These days, the American President is one of the most powerful men in
the world. He can make war, or peace. He can touch the lives of millions
in many different countries, but the President cannot do just what he
wants. The Congress must agree first.

时至今日，美国总统是世界上最有权势的人物之一。他能发动战争，也可带来和平；他能触及诸多国家的几百万条性命，不过他也不可随心所欲。总统要做的事要事先得到国会的批准。

in some ways, the United States is like fifty small countries and not one
large one. Every state has its own governor, its own police, and its own
laws. For example, in some states you can buy an alcoholic drink when
you are 18. In others, you must wait until you are 21

在某些方面，美国像是五十个小国而不是一个统一的大国。各州均有自己的州长、自己的警察和法律。比如，在有些州，年满十八岁可以买酒精饮料，但在其他州，要等到二十一岁才行。

The government of the whole country (the 'federal' government) works
from Washington, the capital city. This is where Congress is based.
Congress has two parts, the Senate, and the House of Representatives

There are 100 members of the Senate (called Senators), two from each
state. The President cannot act without the Senate's agreement. The
House of Representatives has 435 members. Like the senators, they can
make new laws.

参议院有一百名成员（称为参议员），每州两名。未经参议院同意总统不能采取任何行动。众议院有四百三十五名众议员。和参议员一样，他们可制定新法。

Americans choose a new President every four years. The election is a
great occasion. It is serious business, of course, but the Americans make
sure that it is fun too.
