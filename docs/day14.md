#  How to run a company

If you want to run a company well, you should remember that there
are four general policies to follow with employees.

如果你想好好运营一家公司，应记住对员工有四项基本原则。
:::

First, pay them what they are worth. When people begin with your
company, they are rarely worth what they are paid, because you are
investing in their future productivity. You should pay people low at the
start, with higher payments once they are established and productive.

:::
首先，按照他们的价值来支付薪水。当员工开始在你的公司工作，很少会得到应有的报酬，因为你投资他们的未来生产力。一开始你应付员工较低的薪水，但一旦他们能力完善，而且富有成效，你就应该给他们涨薪水。
:::

Second, you should make employees feel important. Build them positively and openly when praise is deserved. Temper this with negative motivation,
pointing out where minor shortcomings are diluting the success that could be enjoyed. Avoid complacency by keeping employees slightly off-balance.

:::
其次，你应该让员工觉得自己很重要。当他们的工作值得表扬，就要积极鼓励，并不吝表扬。如果使用消极动力，无足轻重的错误也要挑出来，这样也冲淡了成功的喜悦。稍稍保持员工不平衡，可以避免他们自满。
:::

Third, make employees think for themselves. Sometimes by being
nonspecific, you create the environment where employees adapt other
ideas and learn how to apply them in the new situation.

:::
第三，让员工自己思考。有时你不给于明确指令，可以创造一个环境，让员工接纳其他想法，并且运用到新的环境中去。
:::

Fourth, separate office life from social life. It is impossible to let your
hair down with someone one night, and come down hard on them the
next day.

:::
第四，办公室和社交生活要明确分开。晚上和人轻松聊天，第二天白天对他严格要求，这是不可能做到的。
:::

You should also remember that if you have to fire employees, take a
creative approach. Try to find a job for them somewhere else, and let the
other company steal them away. However, if extreme action is called for,
act decisively while respecting the feeling of the employee.

:::
你要记住，如果要解雇员工，要采用创造性的方法。比如为他们在其他公司谋职，然后让其他公司把他们挖去。但是，如果发生极端行为，要果断行事，同事尊重员工的感受。
:::

Never expect from your employees anything that you are not willing
to do yourself. It’ s more than a cliché—it’s sound business practice.

:::
绝不要期待你的员工去做你自己不愿做的工作。我知道这是老生常谈，但是的确是良好的商业行为。
