# Sleep

Scientists suggest that today, most adults get up to two hour's less sleep than they need. As a result, those lacking in sleep are `forgeful`, tired, less `productive` and `grumpy`. Sleep is the time when our boudies and minds are rested and `restored`.

There are two types of sleep. Rapid Eye Movement and Non-REM. We need both types to be healthy. Rapid Eye Movement sleep is when we dream. Our brains are active, and our eyes have fast short movements, as if watching something. This type of sleep helps restore our mind.

睡眠有两种形式：快速眼动睡眠和非快速眼动睡眠。这两种睡眠我们都需要，以维护我们的健康。快速眼动睡眠时，我们在做梦。我们的大脑很活跃，眼睛在快速运动好像在看什么东西。这种形式的睡眠帮助我们恢复心智。

Non-REM sleep is when our brain and body slow down. Our heart rate slows and our breathing is regular. This type of sleep helps restore our body. We have twice as much Non-REM sleep as Rapid Eye Movement sleep each night. To get better sleep, have a regular time for sleeping and routine before you go to bed.

非快速眼动睡眠时，我们的大脑和身体活动减少，心跳变慢，呼吸均匀。这种形式的睡眠帮助我们恢复体力。每天晚上，我们的非快速眼动睡眠时间是快速眼动睡眠时间的两倍。要想睡得更好，睡觉的时间要有规律，睡觉前要有特定的程序。

This will give your body the signal that it is time to sleep. Make sure the bed and bedroom are quiet and comfortable. If your bed is too hard or too soft, if you are too cold or to hot, you will not sleep well. For two hours before going to bed do not drink coffee or alcohol, or do not smoke or exercise. All these activities stimulate your body and make sleep diffcult.

这样会给身体一个要睡觉了的信号。要确保床和卧室安静舒适。如果床太硬了或者太软了，身体太热了或者太冷了，都睡不好。睡觉前两个小时内不要喝咖啡或酒精饮料，不要抽烟或者锻炼身体。这些活动会使你的身体兴奋起来，使入睡变得困难。
