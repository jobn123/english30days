#  Caring for the Five Senses

Everyone has five senses. The five senses are sight, hearing, smell,
taste and touch. We use different body parts for different senses. We
need to take care of the parts of our bodies that let us use our senses.

:::
每个人都有5种感觉官能,分别是视觉,听觉、嗅觉、味觉和触觉。不同的感觉官 能对应不同的身体部位,所以我们要好好照顾这些身体器官。
:::

For example, you use your eyes for seeing. You should protect your
eyes and have a doctor regularly check your eyesight. Don't sit too close
to the TV or computer monitor, and don't read in the dark or in dim light.
Never look directly at the sun or at very bright lights.

:::
例如,看东西要用到眼,每个人都应该保护自己的眼睛并定期去医院检查视力。不要离电视或电脑屏幕太近,不要在黑暗中或昏暗的灯光下看书,也绝对不要直视太阳或其他强光。
:::

Your ears let you hear the things around you. You should clean your
ears all the time. Don't listen to loud music, and try to avoid places that
are really loud. Protect your ears when you play sports.

:::
听周围的声音要用到耳朵。要时常清洁耳朵,听音乐时音量不宜过大,注意避开嘈杂的地方,而且运动时也要注意保护耳朵。
:::

Your nose cleans the air you breathe and lets you smell things. Avoid
things that have very strong smells.

:::
鼻子能净化我们吸入体内的空气并让我们闻出物体的气味。要避免接触具有刺激性气味的物体。
:::

Your tongue helps you taste things you eat and drink. Your skin
protects your body from germs and gives you sense of touch. Always
wash your hands after blowing your nose, playing outside, or using the
restroom. Protect your skin from sunburns. Use sunscreen to protect
your skin from the sun.

:::
舌头能让我们品尝食物和饮料的味道。皮肤会阻挡病菌进入体内并让人拥有触觉。擤鼻子、外出玩耍以及上卫生间之后一定要洗手。为了防止皮肤晒伤,还应该涂抹防晒霜以阻隔烈日的暴晒。
