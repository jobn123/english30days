在任何关系中，沟通都极其重要。沟通的重要性再强调也不为过。随着时间推移，缺乏沟通会产生许多问题，并且问题会不断累加。

It is often seen that the families where people talk to each other frequently
are happier. They share their joys, sorrows and other emotions with each other. There is a lively atmosphere in such families. They laugh it out together and celebrate every moment whole-heartedly.Such is the importance of communication.

通常而言，家庭成员如果沟通频繁，那么这家人就会生活更愉快。他们分享喜悦、悲伤和其他感情。整个家庭都会因此而生机勃勃。他们同欢笑，全心全意庆祝每一刻。由此可见，沟通如此重要。

Compared to this, the families where all the members are busy with their own tasks are usually not as happy. The atmosphere in such families is
quite dull and gloomy. They plan outings with their friends and colleagues rather than their family members.

:::
相对而言，家庭成员如果么个人都忙自己的事情，家庭就没那么快乐。这个家庭的整个氛围非常沉闷和阴郁。家庭成员各自安排和他们的朋友和同事出行，而不是和其他家庭成员一起出行。
:::

This is because they have neglected the importance of communication all along and are thus not comfortable communicating with each other. And without good communication there is no way one can enjoy. People in such families often find themselves lonely and even get into depression.

:::
这是因为他们一直忽视沟通的重要性，因而沟通的时候也觉得不自在。家庭成员会觉得自己很孤独，甚至会患上抑郁症。
:::


Similarly, lack of communication is harmful in every situation. We
must all realise the importance of communication.

:::
同样地，每一种情况缺乏沟通都是有害的。我们必须意识到沟通的重要性。
