#  The American Way of Marriage

"I do." To Americans those two words carry great meaning. They can
even change your life. Especially if you say them at your own wedding.
Making wedding vows is like signing a contract, Now Americans don't
really think marriage is a business deal. But marriage is serious business.

「我愿意」这句话对美国人而言具有重大意义，它甚至可以改变你的生命，特别是当你在自己的婚礼上说出这句话时，在婚礼中所发的誓言就如同签订契约一样，美国人并不是真把婚姻当作商业交易，但是，结婚确实是件严肃的事情。

It all begins with engagement. Traditionally, a young man asks the
father of his sweetheart for permission to marry her. If the father agrees,
the man later proposes to her. Often he tries to surprise her by "popping
the question" in a romantic way. Sometimes the couple just decides
together that the time is right to get married. The man usually gives his
fiancée a diamond ring as a symbol of their engagement. They may be
engaged for weeks, months or even years.

结婚是从订婚开始，在传统上，年轻人会请求他的女朋友的父亲允许他娶她，如果女方的父亲答应，之后方可向女方求婚。通常男方会试着以罗曼蒂克的方式「提出这个问题」以带给女方惊喜。有时候双方会觉得现在结婚正是时候，于是男方通常会送女方钻戒作为互订终身的象征。他们可能订婚几个星期、几个月，甚至几年
