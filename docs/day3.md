How fast should you go? Jog with a friend and talk to each other as you run. If you have difficulty talking, you are going too fast. How far should you jog? Remember not to go too far too soon. In fact you should walk,
not run, the first few times. Then do some short jogs, but no more than what you can do comfortably.

你应该跑多快? 和朋友一起慢跑，边跑边交谈。如果你说话有困难，说明你跑得太快了。你应该慢跑多远? 记住不要跑得太远太快。事实上，开始的几次你应该走路，而不是跑步。然后做一些短的慢跑，但不要超过你能舒服地做的程度。
